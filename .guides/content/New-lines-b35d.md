If you ran the code on the previous page, you can see that we now have our data read in successfully.

However, this is really just a single string of pure text. It is not in an array format that is ueful for programs to work with. 

## New lines
The reason our data displays nicely on 2 lines when we run the code is that each line of data has a new line character at the end. You can't actually *see* this character, but it is there. 

A common name for the new line is *carriage return*. This harks back to the days of the typewriter when a typist had to return the carriage mechanism back to the start of the line. 

We use this character to *delimit* (separate) one line from another. This is rather like we used the `,` to separate one field from the next.
